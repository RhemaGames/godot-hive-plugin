# godot-hive-plugin
Hive blockchain plugin for Godot without need for external libraries. 

This is a complete rewrite of previous Hive blockchain integration with Godot writen by Ben Flanagin. Previous attempts required external libraries and tools to create a bridge but this plugin should be 100% Native Godot and hopefully easier to maintain. When complete it should allow for a developer to create a complete Hive interface in Godot which then can be used on a miriad of devices. The plugin will also include serveral basic UI's that can be used in a game or application. 

### Goals
1. Sign and transmit valid transactions.
2. Secure local Wallet
3. Post retrieval
4. local caching of user data
5. Connection to several 2nd layer services
6. ipfs support?
